				<li>Eastern Washington Univeristy 2012-Present</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Work</h2>
			<p>I currently work at EWU's Costume Shop in the Theater department as a seamstress. What started out as a simple workstudy job turned into one of the most fun jobs I have had the honor of working. I've been there since my first quarter of school in 2012.</p>

			<h2>Other Information About Me</h2>
			<p>I grew up in the Spokane area, in the cozy little town of Nine Mile Falls. I currently reside in Cheney, and probably will remain here until I finish school. I spend my freetime watching internet videos, playing videogames, and hanging out with my sister, her husband, and their cute corgi puppy.</p>
